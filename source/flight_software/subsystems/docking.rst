Docking System
==============

The docking system has three components: the docking magnets, the docking motor, and the
docking switch. The latter two components are controllable and readable by flight software.

Our docking at a range of 1 m happens passively via 4 strong neodymium magnets stored in
the docking adapters of the two satellites. During nominal mission operation, the strong
fields created by these magnets would wreak havoc with the onboard magnetometers, so
they are nominally stowed in a quadrupole configuration so that they have very little
net magnetic field past the docking face. This is achieved by having two magnets point N-S,
and another, adjacent set of magnets point S-N.

The docking magnets are reconfigured from their quadrupole arrangement to a dipole arrangement
via the docking motor, which is a stepper motor that turns one of the magnet pairs in the
right direction for achieving the correct polarity.

During the docking operation, both satellites have a switch on their docking face that is depressed
when the satellites dock with one another. The switch is how we detect that the actual docking
operation occurred.
