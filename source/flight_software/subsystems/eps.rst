Power Management
================
Our satellite runs on the Gomspace NanoPower P31U battery + management unit. It's an space-rated
system built for CubeSats and has an I2C interface that provides nearly complete control over
all aspects of the Gomspace's function. We employ two primary functions: checking the state-of-charge
of our batteries and solar power systems, and power-cycling the Gomspace's programmable outputs
when desired.

Reading state
=============
The Gomspace provides a `housekeeping packet` of data that is requested by the satellite on every 
control cycle. This housekeeping packet contains the following important elements:

- The battery voltage
- The total system current output
- The total current into the system via the solar panels
- The boost converter voltages. These are the voltages set across the solar panels by the MPPT
  (maximum power point tracking) system, which adjusts the voltages such that the total power
  generated by the solar panels (which is voltage x current) is maximized.
- Output values (on or off), one for each of the six programmable outputs on the Gomspace.
- Time remaining on the I2C watchdog timer. If this time gets close to zero, the Gomspace automatically
  resets power on the entire spacecraft in order to try to re-establish Flight Software and Gomspace
  communication. The intent of this feature is to shake flight software out of any infinite loops or
  fault conditions that might be causing it to stall.
- Number of reboots of the Gomspace system (and by extension, the entire satellite)
- Cause of the last reboot
- More things I'm forgetting off the top of my head

Commanding
==========

The gomspace will only set PV voltages when the Power Point Tracking mode is in ``Fixed``.
